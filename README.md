# BigData

2020 Group project to analyse gene data and determine likelihood of a mutant phenotype developing based predictive modelling of known collected data.
Will use APIs to pull known genetic data from databanks such as Ensembl to train a model and test data from openSNP.org to feed into the model and predict genetic predisposition.
